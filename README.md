# About

This project allows displaying family tree data stored in csv tables as graphs on a website.
It uses Cola.js and d3.js.
Documentation is stored in the doc directory.

# üöÄ Roadmap

- [x] Dynamic expanding of the graph
- [ ] Dynamic node sizing, fix shape of dead nodes
- [ ] Track generation (allows marking people without any dates as dead)
- [ ] Allow data editing
- [ ] Provide example data (vocabulary in different languages, tv shows, royal families, ...)
- [ ] More languages
- [ ] Generate as much data in javascript as possible (especially age and full name)
- [ ] Input at start to type your name and view your personal family tree
- [ ] Don't reload the whole graph when adding new nodes
- [ ] Upload only one file
- [ ] Support for standardized open file formats for family trees
- [ ] Improve inputs for navigation (f. e. two-finger drag on touchpad)
- [ ] Dynamic data loading to show custom properties
- [ ] Show marriage data

# üå≥ Usage

The family data is represented in two tables:
- one for all the people

 > ‚ö†Ô∏è ID `0` is reservedÔ∏è for the unknown person. It can be used in families with unknown partnersÔ∏è

| ID  | full_name  | born  | named | gender | child_of | birthday   | place_of_birth | day_of_death | age | profession             | religion                 |
|-----|------------|-------|-------|--------|----------|------------|----------------|--------------|-----|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 0   | unknown    |       |       |        |          |            |                |              |     |                        |                          |
| 1   | John Doe   | Smith |       | male   |          | 01.09.1919 | Dirmingcan     | 10.10.2010   | 91  | professional describer | flying spaghetti monster |
| 2   | Miriam Doe |       |       | female |          | 02.02.1902 | Ohoho          | 03.03.2003   | 101 | example giver          | -                        |
| 3   | Kim Doe    |       |       | divers | 1        | 01.02.2001 |                |              | 20  |                        |                          |

- one for all the families:

| ID  | partner1 | partner2 |
|-----|----------|----------|
| 0   | 1        | 2        |


# üé® Alternative design

On the branch _straight_lines_, every link is drawn straight only using 90¬∞ angles. Instead of the rings, partnerships are only indicated by to connection of nodes.
This branch was not updated in a while.
