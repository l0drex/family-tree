# ðŸŒ³ About

This is a web application to display family tree data locally in your browser.
Just select a GedcomX json file and off you go!
There is also a demo button to load some randomly generated example data to explore all features.
Try it out over here on [GitHub Pages](https://l0drex.github.io/family-tree/)!.

To create a simple GedcomX file, you can create a spreadsheet
and convert that with my [GedcomX converter](https://github.com/l0drex/csv_to_gedcomx).
Note that you have to follow a specific format described on that page.
